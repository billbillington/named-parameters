# named-parameters

A small and simple utility for working with named parameters in JavaScript/CoffeeScript. (Inspired by [optimist](https://github.com/substack/node-optimist).)

# Note

This module is developed following the [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) workflow/branching model.

The default [master](https://github.com/rodw/named-parameters) branch only contains the released versions of the code and hence may seem relatively stagnant (or stable, depending upon your point of view).

Most of the develop action happens on the [develop](https://github.com/rodw/named-parameters/tree/develop) branch or in feature branches.
